This repository serves as a second brain for my work in Developer Relations (devrel).

I will slowly add our processes, ideas, and everything needed to be successful with devrel. It's a work-in-progress, but I firmly believe other companies, or individual contributor, could benefit from my expertise and experience of doing developer relations.

As always, we value constructive feedback. Welcome home!

## Developer Relations

### My Mission

I help developers be successful by nurturing a healthy and welcoming community around my employer ecosystem. This means listening to, advocating for, inspiring, educating, and supporting our community however I can.

### The 3Cs

![The foundation of devrel explained in the next paragraph](img/devrel-3Cs.svg)

<!-- vale Custom.spelling = NO -->
The three pillars of Developer Relations are **C**ommunity, **C**ontent, and **C**ode, also known as the 3Cs*.
<!-- vale Custom.spelling = YES -->

The main focus of our team is the community: just read our mission to understand that everything we do is for our developer community. To help us achieve our mission, we use two main activities: content and code. The former is any type of content on any useful medium; some examples are talks at conferences, the developer documentation, or video tutorials. The latter, code, is part of the foundation of who we are: we are developers. It translates into code examples for the documentation, code demos for our conference presentations, technical support, demo applications, or even being responsible for specific APIs or contributing to open source to give back to the community and be a good web citizen. All together, they form the foundation of developer relations.
