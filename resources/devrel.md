_\* Please don't do this: a program that give a $25 gift card to the best performing article monthly. Pay guest writers properly, or do something like DigitalOcean program, and give a decent donation to the writer's non-profit of choice. Writing great blog posts is a skill, and takes time, don't use these programs as a way to get cheap labor "in exchange for visibility". I'm still listing their program as the details could be useful._
